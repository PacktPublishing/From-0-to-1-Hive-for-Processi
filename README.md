## About the Video Course
Hive is like a new friend with an old face (SQL). This course is an end-to-end, practical guide to using Hive for Big Data processing. Let's parse that A new friend with an old face: Hive helps you leverage the power of Distributed computing and Hadoop for Analytical processing. Its interface is like an old friend: the very SQL like HiveQL. This course will fill in all the gaps between SQL and what you need to use Hive. End-to-End: The course is an end-to-end guide for using Hive: whether you are analyst who wants to process data or an Engineer who needs to build custom functionality or optimize performance - everything you'll need is right here. New to SQL? No need to look elsewhere. The course has a primer on all the basic SQL constructs, Practical: Everything is taught using real-life examples, working queries and code
